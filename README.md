## Introduction

<div style = "text-align:justify">
Battleship is a classic strategy 2-players game. This game is the product of the final project in Data Structure and Algorithm course. Our project attempts to apply our understandings of object-oriented programming, data structure and algorithms to build this game with variations of new features and a BotAI to play with the player.

### How to play:question:
<div style="text-align:justify">

- Each will place their ships of various sizes on a 12x12 board. The player each takes turns to "shoot" the ing, the player will know opposing player's ship by guessing their opponent's ships position. After each guess, the game will let the player know if their guess is a "hit", a "miss". A ship is "sunk" when the player have shot all of the positions of the ship. The player wins when they have sunk all of their opponent's ships.
