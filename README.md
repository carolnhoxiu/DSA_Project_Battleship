## Introduction

 Battleship is a classic strategy 2-players game. This game is the product of the final project in Data Structure and Algorithm course. Our project attempts to apply our understandings of object-oriented programming, data structure and algorithms to build this game with variations of new features and a BotAI to play with the player.
